Overview :

This project focuses on developing a linear regression model, a fundamental machine learning technique,
to identify relationships between variables and make predictions.
The goal is to explore the dataset and apply statistical insights for accurate trend analysis.

Features:-
- Automated data preprocessing
- Linear regression model training and testing
- Performance metrics display
- Visualization of the regression line

- Results include:-
-  Preprocessed dataset
- Regression metrics (RÂ², Mean Squared Error)
- Visualization of regression line and predictions
